# Module: accounts.py

This module simulates a simple account management system for a trading platform. It enables users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, trade shares, and inquire about their account status, holdings, and transaction history. The module consists of one main class `Account` that serves as the interface for all operations.

## Classes and Function Definitions

  - `initial_deposit`: The amount of money initially deposited.

#### `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Adds funds to the account balance.
- **Parameters:**
  - `amount`: The amount of money to deposit.

#### `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Withdraws funds from the account if a sufficient balance is available.
- **Parameters:**
  - `amount`: The amount of money to withdraw.
- **Returns:**
  - `True` if the withdrawal is successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Buys a specified quantity of shares for a given symbol if funds are sufficient.
- **Parameters:**
  - `symbol`: The stock symbol.
  - `quantity`: The number of shares to purchase.
- **Returns:**
  - `True` if the purchase is successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Sells a specified quantity of shares for a given symbol if the user owns sufficient shares.
- **Parameters:**
  - `symbol`: The stock symbol.
  - `quantity`: The number of shares to sell.
- **Returns:**
  - `True` if the sale is successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
- Calculates and returns the total value of all shares currently owned, plus cash balance.

#### `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
- Calculates and returns the profit or loss compared to the initial deposit.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
- Returns a report of current shares held and their quantities.

#### `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
- Returns a list of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, buy/sell) made over time.

#### `can_withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Helper function to determine if a withdrawal can be made without a negative balance.
- **Parameters:**
  - `amount`: The amount of money to check.
- **Returns:**
  - `True` if the withdrawal is possible, `False` otherwise.

This design provides a clear, coherent structure for the module, ensuring all requirements are met within a single Python module. Each method is carefully crafted to interact with user accounts, managing deposits, withdrawals, transactions, and balances while preventing invalid operations.
